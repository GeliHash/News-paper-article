        <p class="headline">WASHINGTON - President Johnson unveiled an ambitious $2 trillion climate change plan yesterday that would transform the nation's energy infrastructure over the next decade, calling it "the most significant investment in our planet's future since the moon landing."
        </p>
        <p>The proposal, dubbed the "Green New Horizon," would create millions of jobs while rapidly accelerating the transition to renewable energy sources. Key components include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Complete decarbonization of the power grid by 2035</li>
            <li>Tax incentives for electric vehicle adoption</li>

        Meanwhile, environmental groups praised the initiative while urging even more aggressive action. "This is a good start, but the science demands we move faster," said Sierra Club executive director Maya Chen.

        <h3 style="color:#990000;">Local Impact</h3>
        <p>For New Yorkers, the plan would mean significant upgrades to subway infrastructure,expanded bike lanes, and new job training programs in green energy sectors. Mayor Williams hailed the proposal as "exactly what cities need to combat climate change while rebuilding our middle class."
